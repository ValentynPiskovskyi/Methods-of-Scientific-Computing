## Project 1 - Alternative

To execute the any of the programs within this project it is necessary to install the following dependencies. 

- numpy
- scipy

It can be done using the following command.

```bash
    pip install <dependency name>
```

To execute Jacobi, Gaiss-Seidl, gradient and conjugate gradient methods on matrices "spa1.mtx", "spa2.mtx", "vem1.mtx" and "vem2.mtx" with thresholds 1e-4, 1e-6, 1e-8 and 1e-10, it is necessary to launch the "validation.py" script, which can be done in the following way (from the "Project1-Alternative-Sparse" or "Project1-Alternative-Dense" directories).

```bash
    python validation.py
```
